**Running the Game:**
- Open the `index.html` file.
- Right-click anywhere in the file.
- Select `Open with Live Server` to launch the game in your default web browser. (Note: You need to have the Live Server extension installed in Visual Studio Code for this step. If you don't have it, you can install it from the VS Code Extensions Marketplace.)
- Alternatively, you can simply open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser without using Live Server.
